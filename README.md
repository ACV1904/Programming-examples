**Suicide rate data analysis**

According to World Health Organization (WHO), every year nearly 800 000 people die due to suicide. Suicides are preventable. There are a number of measures that can be taken at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts.
To determine the years and age groups most at risk of suicide, we will examine the suicide rates of countries that participated in surveys between 1985 and 2016. This data is available in the dataset called who_suicide_statistics_modifed3.csv
